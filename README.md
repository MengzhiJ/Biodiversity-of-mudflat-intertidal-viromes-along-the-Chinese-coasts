The alignment results of viral proteins with the functional gene database and the relative abundance of viral genes.
#### 2. amoC-pmoC_output
The NcycDB alignment outputs and the phylogenetic tree based on the maximum likelihood of amoC and pmoC genes.
#### 3. checkv_output
The full outputs of checkv v1.0.1, including the completeness, contamination, and quality summary of intertidal viruses.
#### 4. genomad_output
The full outputs of genomad v1.7.4, including the taxonomic assignment and marker gene anotation of intertidal viruses.
#### 5. iphop_output
The full outputs of iphop v1.3.2, including the host prediction of intertidal viruses.
#### 6. kegg-decoder_output
The metabolic pathway annotations of host microbial operational taxonomic units (mOTUs) belonging to Deltaproteobacteria, Thermodesulfobacteria, and Thaumarchaeota based on the KEGG-Decoder module.
#### 7. viralRefseq_align_output
The identification of viral-like genes within intertidal viruses based on the viral RefSeq. 
#### 8. virsorter2_viralrecall_output
The virsorter2 (NCLDV mode) and viralrecall outputs of nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDVs) and virsorter2 (lavidaviridae mode) output of virophages identified in this study.
